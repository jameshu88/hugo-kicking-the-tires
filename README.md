# Hugo Exploration Repository

## Introduction

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is James, and I'm a computer science + cognitive science student at the University of Pennsylvania. This repository is a part of my journey to get more comfortable with coding, specifically through using Hugo, a powerful and flexible static site generator. By following Hugo's official guide, starting with "Chapter 1: Kicking the Tires", I aim to build a solid foundation in managing and creating scalable websites.

## About Hugo

Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides a fast and modern framework for building websites without the need for a database. It's known for its speed, flexibility, and wide range of features that cater to both beginners and experienced developers. Hugo makes it easy to create and manage content, offering a seamless experience from development to deployment.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to track my progress through Hugo's tutorials, starting with the basics. "Chapter 1: Kicking the Tires" serves as my entry point into Hugo, allowing me to understand its core concepts, installation process, and basic site generation commands. Through this project, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of static site generation and improve my coding skills in a practical, hands-on way.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding the installation process and setup of Hugo.
- Familiarity with Hugo's directory structure and how to create a new site.
- Generating static pages and managing content with Hugo.
- Customizing themes and exploring Hugo's flexibility in design and functionality.

## Feedback and Contributions

I'm always looking to improve and learn more! If you have any feedback, suggestions, or want to share your own experiences with Hugo, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration is key to growth, and I'm excited to learn from the community.

## Acknowledgments
